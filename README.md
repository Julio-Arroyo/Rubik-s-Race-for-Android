# Rubik-s-Race-for-Android

This repository contains the source code to a personal coding project I did for fun and for the challenge of doing it. It is a mobile game for Android inspired in the Rubik's Race board game.
The game features a 5x5 board with swipable tiles, a 3x3 "shuffler" which presents a pattern that the user has to replicate in the 5x5 board, a stopwatch that saves the best score and a pause menu.
